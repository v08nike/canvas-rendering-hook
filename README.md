Assume the response above is the 2 scenes data for an 8 seconds long 16:9 video. You are 
required to draw an HTML canvas to play those scenes in order.
Expected output: the video will play, pause and stop when user click on the canvas.
Extra efforts:
● Write in React hook to handle the playing state
● Play the video from 5th second when the second scene starts
● Text animations. Eg. typing text
● Scene transitions
● Play music in background
